When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    I would want to keep a remote copy of my work as a more permanent and public backup. If my computer were damaged, I could retrieve my files without any problem. Also, if I or anyone else working on a different machine wanted to contribute to my work, a remote repository would greatly aid in this.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If multiple people were working on the same remote repository, any addition of broken code would affect everyone if Git automatically backed up. This would be a problem even for different, not necessarily broken code. Git chose manual, and it's pretty consistent about it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    These are links between sets of commits in each case. Forks are GitHub-GitHub links, clones are GitHub-local links, and branches are local-local links. Working locally, I would have no choice but to use branching only. If I were contributing to a project or not bothering to remotely back up my own work, I might use clone directly to borrow from a repository. If I wanted to alter or play with someone else's code, I would use a fork.
