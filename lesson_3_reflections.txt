When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    I would want to keep a remote copy of my work as a more permanent and public backup. If my computer were damaged, I could retrieve my files without any problem. Also, if I or anyone else working on a different machine wanted to contribute to my work, a remote repository would greatly aid in this.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If multiple people were working on the same remote repository, any addition of broken code would affect everyone if Git automatically backed up. This would be a problem even for different, not necessarily broken code. Git chose manual, and it's pretty consistent about it.
